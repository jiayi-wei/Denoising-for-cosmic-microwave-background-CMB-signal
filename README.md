# Denoising-for-cosmic-microwave-background-CMB-signal
This project is to denoise a 2D-array with tough noise. The signal is from a Astronomical telescope which contains a influential effection on the useful signal. Hence, I build a AutoEncoder model trained on my dataset which isbuilt with tensorflow. There is annotions in both 'train.py' and 'train_on_gpu.py'. hte files containing 'read.py' and 'data_process.py' are just specially for my dataset.
